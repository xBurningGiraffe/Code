# NmapMD

## Description
This Python script automates the process of running nmap scans and formats the output into a Markdown file. It's designed to make it easier to document and review the network environments you are analyzing.

## Features
- Runs nmap scans with user-defined arguments.
- Generates a Markdown file that documents discovered hosts, their IP addresses, open ports, and operating system details if available.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- nmap: Must be installed on the system and accessible via the command line.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/nmap-markdown.git
cd nmap-markdown
```

## Usage
To use the script, you can pass nmap arguments directly through the command line. For example:
```bash
./nmapMD.py -o output_filename.md 192.168.208.226 -p 135,139,445 -vv
```

This command runs an nmap scan on the IP address `192.168.208.226` with verbose output for ports 135, 139, and 445, and outputs the results to `output_filename.md`.

## Example of Output
The following screenshot shows an example of the Markdown output generated by this script:

The Markdown file includes a table listing the discovered hosts, IP addresses, operating system details (if detected), open ports, and additional notes.
